# FrogCalls
### :frog: *Can we infer the genus of frogs from their call ?* :frog: :ear:


This project relies on the [Anuran Calls (MFCCs) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Anuran+Calls+%28MFCCs%29) to predict genus from frog calls.

## Files

* Data :  ```Anuran_Calls/```
* Notebooks :  ```notebooks/```
* references ```references/```
* virtual environment : ```env_frog/```


> **Note:** Repository is 147.6 Mo big.

## How to use env

**Set new source**

```bash
source FrogCalls/env_frog/bin/activate
```

**Check that python is now 3.8**
```bash
python3 --version 
```

**Add env to Jupyter Notebooks**

```bash
cd FrogCalls/
python3 -m ipykernel install --name=env_frog
```

**Change the kernel in Jupyter notebook to be env_frog**

**Check that your kernel has successfully changed**

you can also run ```pip3 list```to see if all the packages are here

**DISCLAIMER**

This tutorial allowed me to use librosa to listen to the MFCCs audio reconstruction, it is not mandatory to use the env, especially since the other libraries should not cause any issues being installed
